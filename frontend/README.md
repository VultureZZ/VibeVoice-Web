# VibeVoice Web UI

A modern React + TypeScript web interface for the VibeVoice text-to-speech API.

## Features

- **Speech Generation**: Convert text to speech with customizable speakers and settings
- **Voice Management**: Create, list, update, and delete custom voices from audio files
- **Create Voice from Clips**: Upload one audio file and select multiple clip ranges to train a voice
- **Voice Profiles**: Analyze an audio file to derive a style profile and apply it to any voice (Ollama-assisted)
- **Article Podcaster**: Generate a multi-voice podcast script from an article URL, then generate audio (Ollama-assisted)
- **Podcast Library**: Save/search/download/delete generated podcasts from the on-disk library
- **Settings**: Configure API endpoint, API key, and default preferences

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- VibeVoice API server running (see main project README)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set `VITE_API_URL` to your API server URL (default: `http://localhost:8000`)

## Development

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at the host/port printed by Vite (defaults are configured in `vite.config.ts`).

The UI calls the API at `VITE_API_URL` (or defaults to `http://localhost:8000`). A Vite `/api` proxy exists in `vite.config.ts`, but the current API client uses an absolute base URL, so the proxy is optional (the backend enables CORS for development).

## Build

Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Production Deployment

### Option 1: Serve as Static Files

The built `dist/` folder can be served by any static file server:
- Copy `dist/` contents to your web server
- Configure your server to serve the files

### Option 2: Serve from FastAPI

You can serve the frontend from the FastAPI backend by adding static file serving:

```python
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles

app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory="frontend/dist", html=True), name="static")
```

### Option 3: Deploy Separately

Deploy to services like:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- GitHub Pages

Make sure to configure the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable in your deployment platform.

## Configuration

Settings are stored in browser localStorage and can be configured through the Settings page in the UI:

- **API Endpoint**: URL of the VibeVoice API server
- **API Key**: Optional API key for authentication
- **Default Settings**: Default language, output format, and sample rate
